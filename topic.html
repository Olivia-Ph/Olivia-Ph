    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>raster-graphics</strong> file format that supports lossless data compression.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></li>
        <li>A popular file type among web designers, due to its possibility of handling graphics with transparent and semi-transparent backgrounds.</li>
        <li>PNG files, which use the .png extension, can handle 16 million colours, distinguishing them from most other file types.</li>

        <h3>History and Developments</h3>
        <h4>History</h4> 
        <p>PNG was known not only as a not-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) but also a significantly larger colour pallette including.</p>
        <p>In 1995, PING was launched by Oliver Fromme, author of the popular JPEG viewer QPEG, and later shortened to PNG, a recursive acronym meaning <em>“PNG is not GIF”</em>, as well as the .png extension.</p>
        <h4>Developments</h4>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">
            “The full specification of PNG was released under the approval of W3C on 1 October 1996, and later as RFC 2083 on 15 January 1997. The specification was revised on 31 December 1998 as version 1.1, which addressed technical problems for gamma and colour correction. Version 1.2, released on 11 August 1999, added the iTXt chunk as the specification’s only change, and a reformatted version of 1.2 was released as a second edition of the W3C standard on 10 November 2003, and as an International Standard (ISO/IEC 15948:2004) on 3 March 2004.” <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A multiple-image format based on PNG may be defined in the future. Such a format will be recognized as a distinct file format with its own signature. Applications that support PNG may or may not support the multiple-image format.</p>

        <h3>What are PNG files used for?</h3>
        <p>The Portable Network Graphic (PNG) file format is a flexible image file format<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. PNGs can be used in a variety of ways, including:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.adobe.com/au/creativecloud/file-types/image/raster/png-file.html">
        <dl>
            <dt><strong><em>Logos with transparent backgrounds</em></strong></dt>
            <dd>Designers often use PNG files for logos. That is because the format supports transparent backgrounds, which means designers can layer logo files on different backgrounds in a way that looks natural.</dd>
            <dt><strong><em>Online charts and graphics</em></strong></dt>
            <dd>The PNG format uses lossless compression, which means that this file type retains of all its original data when compressed. This makes PNGs great for detailed graphics and charts on websites because none of the vital information gets lost.</dd>

        <h3>PNG vs JPEG: What is the difference?</h3>
        <p>Despite their similarity and common use, JPEG and PNG files have a lot of differences<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. Find out its differences below:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Lossless vs. lossy compression: </strong>JPEGs use a lossy compression algorithm, which means that some data from the image is permanently lost when it is compressed. PNG files, on the other hand, benefit from lossless compression. This implies that when you compress an image, no data is lost, and the quality remains the same no matter how many times you alter and save the file.</li>
            <li><strong>File size: </strong>The JPEG format can produce a smaller file than the PNG format, which is beneficial if you don’t have a lot of disc space to work with — and can also help to speed up page loading times.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency: </strong>Transparent backgrounds are not supported by JPEGs. JPEG images will also have a hard time blending in with web sites that have a variety of background colours. Transparency is supported by PNG files, on the other hand. It means that PNG images blend better with various backdrop colours on a page and that text is easier to see.</li>

    <h3>What is aPNG. file?</h3>
    <p>It is simply a animated PNG file. aPNG is just like a Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), but of much higher quality. APNG competes with MNG, a powerful format for bitmapped animations created by the same team as PNG. APNG's advantage is the smaller library size and compatibility with older PNG implementations. </p>
    <section>
        <h3>History and Developments</h3>
        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>In 2001, the developers of PNG published the Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) format, with support for animation. MNG achieved moderate application support, however, popular online browsers did not support it, and web site designers and publishers did not use it. </p>
        <h4>Developments<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></h4>
        <ul>
            <li><cite>In 2008, certain Mozilla developers published the Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) format with similar goals.</cite></li>
            <li><cite>APNG is a format that is natively supported by Gecko- and Presto-based web browsers and is also commonly used for thumbnails on Sony's PlayStation Portable system.</cite></li>
            <li><cite>In 2017, Chromium based browsers adopted APNG support.</cite></li>
            <li><cite>In January 2020, Microsoft Edge became Chromium based, thus inheriting support for APNG.</cite></li>
